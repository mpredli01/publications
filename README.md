This example application demonstrates database operations using the latest release of [Speedment 3.0.1](http://www.speedment.org/) and is adapted from the [Speedment Code Examples](https://github.com/speedment/speedment-code-samples). The database schema can be found in the file, `publications.sql`. 

The application can be built and run with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) by executing the command:

`mvn compile && mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.redlich.publications.Main"`
